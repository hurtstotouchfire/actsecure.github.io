Ok snobby techies. We, a cybersecurity collective, would like to encourage you to give WordPress a chance. As organizers at the intersection of technology and activism, we often talk to programmers and web developers who want to "help" with activism, but aren't willing to work outside their technical expertise or preferences. That's great that you're a DBA; what we need is someone to set up [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) on an organization's website. And if you're only willing to program in Python, I'm not sure if we need your skills in the resistance. So, point one: tech folks need to be ready to do what needs to be done, and not what they like / are good at doing.

One of the platforms we hear being bashed the most frequently is WordPress. And this makes us angry. 


In solidarity,
ActSecure

Need WP community stats. Or at least PHP by gender / sexuality.

Why Wordpress?

- Most nonprofits use it

- Most web developers are familiar with it

- It’s very customizable



What Kelly recorded:



One thing to add is that there’s a really strong community of Wordpress developers and that many of the people in that community are women and queer folks and in other parts of the tech field those people are very much in the minority. So, the Wordpress community is one of the areas that, Wordpress and Droople, which are both PHP, where there are more folks who are career changers and also more women and queer people. So as a result, the community I think has a better values set. So that’s one other point. And then, the other point is that, one the biggest points against is that people sometimes worry about the security of it. But it is totally possible to have a secure installation of it and that we can help make that happen and because so many nonprofits use it it’s better for us to invest in best practices as far as like having a secure installation. Does that make sense? It’s an area where we can be part of a positive community and also be part of setting a good example in that community.
